# On Location - frontend

The goal of this project was to create an application for movie enthusiasts to record information about the real-world locations of scenes in movies.

Many people enjoy touring the real world locations of their favorite movies, and this would allow them to have access to user curated information and not be reliant on a movie tour company.

This is the frontend associated with the [backend api](https://github.com/wsparsons/on-location-backend).
